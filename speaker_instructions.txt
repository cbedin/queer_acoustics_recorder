Before we start recording, please use this page to test your recording conditions. To take a test recording, press "Record" or "Re-record" and speak into your computer's microphone, and press "Stop" to listen to the recording on the audio player below. You can and should repeat this process as many times as you need until you've set up your surroundings for optimal sound quality. Your voice should be clear and audible with no background noise or echo/reverberation.
 
When recording you should position yourself approximately 12 inches away from your computer's microphone. If possible, we recommend recording inside a closet.
 
For testing purposes, try reading the following sentence out loud:
 
"The cartoon features a muskrat and a tadpole."
